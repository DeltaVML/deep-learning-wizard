# Linear Algebra with NumPy and CuPy

In this section, we will be covering linear algebra and using numpy for CPU-based matrix manipulation and cupy for GPU-based matrix manipulation.

## Types of Matrices

* M x N Matrix: M rows and N columns
* 1 x N Matrix (Row Vector): 1 row and N columns
* M x 1 Matrix (Column Vector): M rows and 1 column
* 1 x 1 Matrix (Scalar): 1 row and 1 column
* N x M Matrix from M x N Matrix (Transposed Matrix): Swapping M rows to columns and N columns to rows where matrix $A$ then becomes transposed matrix $A\prime$
* Symmetric Matrix: M x N Matrix is equal to N x M Transposed Matrix
* M x M Matrix (Square Matrix): M rows = N columns
* Diagonal Matrix: all matrix elements are zeroes except for the diagonal
* Identity matrix: all matrix elements are zeroes except for the diagonals being 1's
